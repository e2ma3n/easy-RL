<td data-title='Descriptions'>Tinyproxy is a HTTP proxy server daemon for POSIX operating systems. Designed to be fast and small, it is useful when an HTTP/HTTPS proxy is required, but the system resources for a larger proxy are unavailable. Because of this it has been put to uses such as a tether on the iPhone, and on the OpenWrt.</td>

<td data-title='Details'><a href='squid/index.html'>Squid</a></td>
<td data-title='Descriptions'>Squid is a caching and forwarding web proxy. It has a wide variety of uses, from speeding up a web server by caching repeated requests; to caching web, DNS and other computer network lookups for a group of people sharing network resources, to aiding security by filtering traffic. Although primarily used for HTTP and FTP, Squid includes limited support for several other protocols including TLS, SSL, Internet Gopher and HTTPS.</td>
